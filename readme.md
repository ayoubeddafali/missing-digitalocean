It comes with handy functionnalities : 

  - Schedule Shutdown of a resource 
  - Schedule Restart of a resource 
  - Schedule Delete of a resource 
  - Shedule Snapshot of a Droplet
  - Schedule Shutdown of all resources in a Project 
  - Schedule Restart  of all resources in a Project 
  - Schedule Delete  of all resources in a Project 
  - ...
